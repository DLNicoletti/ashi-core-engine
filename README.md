### ASHI-CORE v2.0.2

Phase Transition Detection in High-Entropy Telemetry Streams

ASHI-CORE is a computational framework designed to quantify signal stability and detect phase transition dynamics in high-entropy telemetry data.

The system is based on a statistical order parameter (K), defined as the ratio between signal dispersion and central tendency, and an empirically observed transition threshold (Kc ≈ 1.441).

### Core Concept

Instead of traditional anomaly detection, ASHI-CORE focuses on identifying structural regime transitions in stochastic signals.

Two regimes are defined:

Stable Regime (K < Kc) Characterized by bounded variability and localized noise

High-Connectivity Regime (K ≥ Kc) Characterized by increased variance propagation and global signal coupling

These transitions can be interpreted as changes in the structural organization of the signal.

### Mathematical Definition

K = σ / µ

where:

µ = mean of the signal
σ = standard deviation
Empirical transition threshold:

Kc ≈ 1.441

Dataset and Validation

The framework has been evaluated on space telemetry datasets, including:

Proton flux measurements
X-ray flux data
Total samples: N = 2246

### Observed results:

Consistent separation between low-variance and high-variance regimes
Robust behavior under stochastic noise conditions
Clear transition boundary around Kc in multiple telemetry streams
Scope

ASHI-CORE is currently positioned as a research-stage framework (TRL3), intended for:

Offline telemetry analysis
Simulation environments
Early-stage predictive modeling pipelines
Limitations

The model provides statistical indicators, not deterministic failure predictions
Threshold values are empirically derived and may require recalibration
No claim of operational deployment is made
Output

The framework produces:

Temporal K-vector (stability evolution)
Phase transition markers
Regime classification (stable vs high-connectivity)
