# ASHI-CORE™

**Phase Transition Detection in High-Entropy Telemetry Streams**

---

## Overview

ASHI-CORE is a computational framework designed to detect **structural regime transitions** in stochastic telemetry data.

Unlike traditional anomaly detection systems, ASHI-CORE identifies **underlying changes in system dynamics**, enabling early detection of instability in mission-critical environments.

---

## Core Concept

The framework is based on a statistical order parameter:

K = σ / μ

where:

* σ = signal dispersion
* μ = central tendency

A critical threshold is defined as:

Kc ≈ 1.441

---

## Regime Interpretation

* K < Kc → Stable regime (localized variability)
* K ≥ Kc → Transition regime (global coupling and instability)

This transition represents a shift in the structural organization of the signal.

---

## Key Capabilities

* Detection of pre-critical transitions before observable anomalies
* Lightweight computation (edge-compatible)
* Domain-agnostic (radiation, thermal, power, bio-signals)
* No model training required

---

## Validation Context

The framework has been evaluated on high-entropy telemetry datasets, including:

* Proton flux (radiation stability)
* X-ray flux (high-energy regime dynamics)

Results indicate consistent separation between stable and transition regimes.

---

## Deployment Potential

ASHI-CORE is designed for integration in:

* onboard satellite systems
* digital twin architectures
* real-time monitoring pipelines
